# Titanic mayhemmm.
It's me again .If you guys are new here im jerome and this is my blog page where i talk about fun ideas and the struggle i had doing some work. In this blog post I would be talking about my struggles in doing my titanic graph work.
 
During the time of some time last week i worked on a titanic graph making project. In that project I learned how to make a graph using a dataset. For example my question was how many people died and how many people survived so i created a graph telling me how much people survied vs how much people didn't. For example my code was : #. What was the age gap around?
df.Age.hist(bins=40)
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Number of Person")
plt.title("Passengers Age");.
Basically in that code it made a graph of the passengers age range.
