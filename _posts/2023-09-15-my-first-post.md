# In my mind
During my summer break i asked myself what do i waanna do in the near future. I had some ideas on what i should do. I thought to myself should i keep on goin with photography or should i pursue a dream with travel nurse. Or do my plan C which is Full Stack Development.

  I researched about photography and found allot of good things on it . I came to the decider that i wanted to do photograpy and travel nurse at the same time so i can try to become a multi-millioner.
