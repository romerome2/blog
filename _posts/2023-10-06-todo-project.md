# OHHH MY Bloggg


Hey it's me again. I'm jerome if some of yall are new here today I would be talking about my project called the Todo and other projects and thigns i learned from the past 2 weeks are so. I would also talk about my overcomes and how i got better at learning the codes.
 
 During the week I learned how to use range in python and i also learned how to use while and for loop. To use range in python is by doing range(). We also learned how to use the while loop and the for loop better. Heres an example :if t == 1:
    d = p + o
    print(d)
elif t ==2:
    d = p - o
    print(d).
